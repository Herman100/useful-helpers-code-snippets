# 🚀 Useful Code Snippets & Helpers

A collection of helpful code snippets, utilities, and helper functions that I've found useful throughout my development journey. This repository serves as a personal knowledge base and quick reference for commonly used code patterns and solutions.

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository is designed to:

- Store and organize useful code snippets
- Provide quick access to common solutions
- Document helpful development patterns
- Share reusable code components

## 📁 Structure

Each code snippet or helper should be organized in its own directory with the following structure:

```
snippet-name/
├── README.md           # Documentation and usage examples
├── code.js            # The actual code snippet
└── test.js            # (Optional) Test cases or examples
```

## ✨ Adding New Snippets

When adding new code snippets, please follow these guidelines:

1. Create a new directory with a descriptive name
2. Include a README.md with:
   - Description of what the snippet does
   - Usage examples
   - Dependencies (if any)
   - Any relevant notes or caveats
3. Add the code in a clearly named file
4. Include comments explaining complex logic
